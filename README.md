# Location-History-App

Have you ever forgotten where you were yesterday and simply couldn't recall no matter how hard you tried? Have you ever been on a hike but didn't record all the places you've been? Well fear not because the Location History Tracker app is for you! With this app, you can view the location of where you been on each day.
